I hope this message finds you well. My name is Taran, and I am an Informatics student currently conducting research on the college admissions process and the role of AI in education for my Research Capstone. As part of this study, we are seeking insights from underclassmen to better understand your experiences and perspectives.

We are inviting first and second-year students to participate in a brief survey designed to gather feedback on your college application experiences and your perspectives on the integration of AI in the admissions process. Your responses will help us understand the challenges and opportunities within the current system and contribute to developing more efficient and equitable admissions processes.

You have been randomly selected for the opportunity to participate in this survey. The survey is completely voluntary and anonymous, and it should take no more than 10 minutes to complete. Your participation would be greatly appreciated and will provide important insights into the student experience.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute to our research. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at tbains@uw.edu.

Best regards,
Taran Bains
